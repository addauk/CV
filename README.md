## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevant to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Nov 2022 to Apr 2023)
- *Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)*

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Love modern boardgames for probably the same reason as development, provides multiple sandboxes of rules and procedures to learn before attempting to turn them towards your own purpose. That and it's a relaxed social activity away from a screen.
